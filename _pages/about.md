### Hello World!


Hi there, I'm Anirban!
I'm an experienced data scientist and engineer (~3.5 yrs) passionate about using machine learning
and deep learning for real-world delivery and impact.

Currently in Transunion CIBIL as a senior data scientist, working with credit data. 

This website is powered by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> & Github Pages, 
which were surprisingly pretty simple to use. The theme is  
<a href="https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/">Minimal Mistakes</a>, which is free and compatible with Github Pages as a remote theme. This website is made with the help of this [Pritesh Shrivastava's repo](https://github.com/pritesh-shrivastava)
